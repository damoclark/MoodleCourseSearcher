The utility should work for any version of Moodle, but has only been tested on
Moodle 3.7

## Installation Instructions ##

### Mozilla Firefox ###

1. If you don't already have it, [Install
Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) into
your Firefox browser.

1. Then, [install Moodle Course
Searcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoclark/MoodleCourseSearcher/master/Moodle_Course_Searcher.user.js).

### Google Chrome ###

1. If you don't already have it, [install
Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
into your Chrome browser. Strictly speaking, this userscript should work without
requiring Tampermonkey. However, recent security changes to Chrome mean this is
just the easiest way to do it.

1. Then, [install Moodle Course
Searcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoclark/MoodleCourseSearcher/master/Moodle_Course_Searcher.user.js)
and you are all set. It doesn't require any special security permissions and
therefore can run as a native Chrome user script.

### Microsoft Edge ###

1. If you don't already have it, [Install
Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=edge) into
your Edge browser.

1. Then, [install Moodle Course
Searcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoclark/MoodleCourseSearcher/master/Moodle_Course_Searcher.user.js).

## Usage ##

Moodle Course Searcher is already configured for use at
[CQUniversity](https://www.cqu.edu.au). This means you can start using it right
away. If, however you wish to use it on another Moodle site, you will need to enable the script to run 
on your Moodle site.
