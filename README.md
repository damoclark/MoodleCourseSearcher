The utility should work for any version of Moodle, but has only been tested on
Moodle 2.7

## Installation Instructions ##

### Firefox ###

Firstly, [Install
Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) into
your Firefox browser.

Then, [install Moodle Course
Searcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoclark/MoodleCourseSearcher/master/Moodle_Course_Searcher.user.js).

### Chrome ###

Just [install Moodle Course
Searcher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damoclark/MoodleCourseSearcher/master/Moodle_Course_Searcher.user.js)
and you are all set. It doesn't require any special security permissions and
therefore can run as a native Chrome user script.

## Usage ##

### Firefox ###

Moodle Course Searcher is already configured for use at
[CQUniversity](https://www.cqu.edu.au). This means you can start using it right
away. If, however you wish to use it on another Moodle site, you will need to
follow the instructions below.

To specify your Moodle website address so Firefox knows when to run this script,
press Ctrl-Shift-A to access the settings (Cmd-Shift-A for Mac)

Then go to your Greasemonkey Scripts.

Next, click on Preferences for Moodle Course Searcher.

Click "Add..." and enter in your Moodle website. Note you need to add an
asterisk on the end as shown in the image below. This asterisk means run Moodle
Course Search on any page of your Moodle website.
